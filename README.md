# Marinelli-Auto-Time-App
A simple time application to track how long we have worked on a specific job


### Project Goals
User should be able to keep track of time spent on projects
Each project will store 4 pieces of information:
+ Project name
+ Time stamp when the project started
+ Time stamp when the project stopped
+ Date the project was created
